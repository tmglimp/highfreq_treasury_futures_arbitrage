Underlying methodology c/o Tuckman in Fixed Income Securities: Tools for Today's Markets (5e). He credits Black and Derman from Columbia U. and Goldman Sachs' FIS desk for inventing equity delta hedging. 
CME/CBOT recognize the method as a UDS recursion in the exchange API's exceptional spreads panel. Pretty neat to see calendar spreads clear at a fixed, covered price.
